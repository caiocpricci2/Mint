Mint - Changelog

0.8.1 

Fixes: 
* Fixed pinch/zoom calculations on small screens
* Limited pan on zoom-out images to prevent dragging images off the screen

Known bugs:

* Using mint leaves a huge empty scrollable area on mobile browsers/webviews
* Limited pan after zoom calculations are not applied correctly
* Would be nice to completely disable scrolling while image is zoomed out

Todo:

* Add not-zoom-out image
* Test on wp8/w8 
* find a better way of zooming-out the zoom-in images. Double tap just doesn't sound right
